# 🛡️ TryHackMe Write-ups

This repository contains my personal write-ups for various rooms and challenges on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/).  
The purpose of this repo is to document the steps, commands, and methodologies I used during each task — both for learning and for future reference.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each write-up is stored in its own folder and usually contains:
- A **Markdown** file (`.md`) with the step-by-step write-up.
- Any **supporting images** or screenshots referenced in the `.md` file.
- (Optional) Extra scripts or files used during the challenge.
## 🛠 Tools & Skills Covered

These write-ups often include techniques and tools such as:
- **Reconnaissance**: `nmap`, `rustscan`, `enum4linux`, `gobuster`, `dirsearch`
- **Exploitation**: `metasploit`, `msfvenom`, manual exploitation
- **Post-Exploitation**: privilege escalation (Linux/Windows), credential harvesting
- **Scripting & Automation**: Bash, Python, PowerShell snippets
- **Crypto/Forensics**: hash cracking, file analysis
- **Web Pentesting**: SQLi, XSS, LFI/RFI, file upload bypass

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

All activities documented here were performed in a controlled environment such as TryHackMe, HackTheBox, or private labs.  
These write-ups are for **educational purposes only**.  
Do **NOT** use any of these techniques on systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test.

## 📌 How to View Images in Write-ups

If a write-up contains images:
- Ensure you **clone the entire repository** (including the img folder) to view them offline.
- On GitHub, images will display automatically if the folder structure is preserved.
